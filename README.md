# Employee Records Management System

## Overview

The Employee Records Management System is a program developed in C# and .NET for managing employee records. It allows users to add, update, and search for employee details such as name, age, and salary. The system is designed to be easy to operate and understand, with access control using admin accounts.

## Features

- Add new employees with their name, age, and salary.
- Update existing employee records.
- Search for employees by name or other criteria.

## Image Forgery Detection

In addition to employee record management, this project also includes functionality for image forgery detection. The system takes an image dataset as input, preprocesses and cleans the data, extracts features based on image masks, and trains deep learning models such as CNN and Transfer Learning. Error Level Analysis (ELA) is used to identify noise in the images, determining whether they are forged or pristine.
